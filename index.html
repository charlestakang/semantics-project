    <h3>Characters</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Okonkwo,</strong> the protagonist, has three wives and ten (total) children and becomes the leader
            of his clan. His father, Unoka, was weak and lazy, and Okonkwo resents him for his weaknesses: he enacts
            traditional masculinity. Okonkwo strives to make his way in a culture that traditionally values manliness.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Ekwefi,</strong> is Okonkwo's second wife. Although she falls in love with Okonkwo after seeing him
            in a wrestling match, she marries another man because Okonkwo is too poor to pay her bride price at that
            time. Two years later, she runs away to Okonkwo's compound one night and later marries him. She receives
            severe beatings from Okonkwo just like his other wives; but unlike them, she is known to talk back to
            Okonkwo.</li>
        <li> <strong>Unoka </strong> is Okonkwo's father, who defied typical Igbo masculinity by neglecting to grow
            yams, take care of his wives and children, and pay his debts before he dies.</li>
        <li><strong>Nwoye</strong> is Okonkwo's son, about whom Okonkwo worries, fearing that he will become like Unoka.
            Similar to Unoka, Nwoye does not subscribe to the traditional Igbo view of masculinity being equated to
            violence; rather, he prefers the stories of his mother. Nwoye connects to Ikemefuna, who presents an
            alternative to Okonkwo's rigid masculinity. He is one of the early converts to Christianity and takes on the
            Christian name Isaac, an act which Okonkwo views as a final betrayal.</li>
        <li> <strong> Ikemefuna</strong> is a boy from the Mbaino tribe. His father murders the wife of an Umuofia man,
            and in the resulting settlement of the matter, Ikemefuma is put into the care of Okonkwo. By the decision of
            Umuofia authorities, Ikemefuna is ultimately killed, an act which Okonkwo does not prevent, and even
            participates in, lest he seems feminine and weak. Ikemefuna became very close to Nwoye, and Okonkwo's
            decision to participate in Ikemefuna's death takes a toll on Okonkwo's relationship with Nwoye.</li>
    </ul>
